This error occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is that the `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` function sometimes returns an empty result array, even when the user successfully selects a file. This leads to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on file selection.  The code below demonstrates this problem.  It uses a try...catch block to handle potential errors, but the empty result array is not caught by the standard error handling.
